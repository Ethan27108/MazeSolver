MazeSolver

This program is a generative algorithym that will create 32 copies that have random moves. Moving towards the goal will award it points and the highest score one will be duplicated and then two more moves will be added and repeat the process until the maze is solved.

This is then displayed using pygame and for loops to show the result in a visual way and has a timer function to see the total amount of time it takes as it was a generative porgram and for the size of a 8x8 maze 32 seems to solve it the fatest.

To run download the file and then run it using python and make sure you have pygame installed whiwch can be installed using pip.
